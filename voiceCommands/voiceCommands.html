        <h3> This tutorial is written by Purdue's ECE electronics shop
          staff for educational purposes. It explores potential ways to use simple
          signal processing and statistical methods in order to detect
          keywords spoken into a mircophone. The code is written in MATLAB, though
          it can be applied to most modern languages. </h3>
